# Why Money

- Barter system can be inefficient

- International trade and investment require convertibility

- More currencies make trade and investment difficult

- Standardization of currencies associated with growth of trade and investment

# Why Money

Example: Pre-Constitution United States  

- States able to print their own currencies

- Relative valuations differed wildly

- Impeded trade among states

# What is Monetary Policy?


> **Monetary Policy**: Changes in a country’s money supply undertaken in an attempt to manage aggregate economic activity (Oatley 2010, 387).  

> **Central Bank**: The institution that regulates monetary conditions in an economy, typically by affecting interest rates and the quantity of money in circulation.

# Why Monetary Policy Matters

Lots of reasons

- If affects the value of your money

- It affects the ease with which you can use your money to buy things

- This, in turn, affects what you can buy and how much it costs

- It can also affect other things, like investment and trade relationships

# Why Monetary Policy Matters

Implications for trade

- We need to exchange our currency for the currencies of the countries we trade with

- For example, buying Chinese exports necessitates that companies (at some point) turn US dollars into Chinese Yuan

# Why Monetary Policy Matters

Implications for trade

- Valuation affects different segments of society in different ways

- Exporters generally benefit from a weaker currency

- Domestic consumers benefit from a stronger currency



---
# Why Monetary Policy Matters

The case of China

- Chinese government made a decision to devalue its currency

- Devaluation begins in the 1980s through 1990s

- Weaker Yuan relative to US dollar promotes Chinese exports

- US policymakers have protested the artificial weakness of Chinese currency in recent years

- Prices are lower for US consumers of Chinese goods, but at the expense of US jobs

# Why Monetary Policy Matters

Example: Shoes made in China and sold in US

- Assume an exchange rate: ¥7 = $1

- 1 pair of shoes costs ¥700 to produce

- 1 pair of shoes costs $100 in the US

- ¥7 x $100 = ¥700



---
# Why Monetary Policy Matters

Example: Shoes made in China and sold in US

- Assume Yuan appreciates to ¥5 (~29%) = $1

- 1 pair of shoes still costs ¥700 to produce 

- 1 pair of shoes now costs $140 in the US 

- ¥5 x $140 = ¥700

# Why Monetary Policy Matters

Types of monetary policies

- Expansionary

  - Intended to stimulate economic activity
  - Lower interest rates, increasing money supply, increasing prices

- Restrictive

  - Intended to slow (“cool”) economy down
  - Increasing interest rates, decreasing money supply, decreasing prices
  
  
  
---
# Why Monetary Policy Matters

Interest rates

- Federal Funds Rate

- The rate that banks charge each other for short-term loans


---
# Why Monetary Policy Matters

Effects of interest rates

- Lowering the target rate… 
  - Makes it cheaper to borrow
  - Facilitates access to domestic capital and stimulates demand

- Increasing the target rate… 
  - Makes it more expensive to borrow
  - Attracts foreign capital (more profitable to invest in country with high rates). 
  


---
# Why Monetary Policy Matters

Effects of lowering interest rates

- Lower rates makes money cheaper and more abundant

- Businesses and people will consume more

- Increased demand and consumption will drive prices up and unemployment down
  
  
  
---
# Why Monetary Policy Matters

Fixed exchange regimes: Gold standard

- Gold standard fixes currency value to gold

- Also limits the money supply (supply is tied to amount of gold)

- Keeps exchange rates stable

- But…State can’t use monetary policy to fix domestic economic problems because government must use interest rates to maintain exchange rate
