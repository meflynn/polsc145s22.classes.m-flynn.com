# Key Questions

1. What is the current state of the international environmental and climate change regimes?

2. Why is it difficult for states and people to cooperate on climate change? What are the sources of conflict?

3. What are some of the key frameworks or mental models we can use to help us understand the politics of environmental issues?

3. How can institutions change the incentives of actors re pollution?

# Why is Cooperation Difficult?

Many reasons:

- Coordinating behavior between multiple countries and billions of people is hard

- Costs of environmental protection are not evenly distributed across individuals, industries, or countries

- Benefits of better protections are often diffuse.

# Why is Cooperation Difficult?

How do we conceptualize environmental issues? What mental models can help us?

We can use concepts we've seen before!

Key concepts:

 - Public goods and Private goods

 - Common pool resources (CPRs): Resources that everyone can access. Examples include fisheries, hunting on public land, etc.

 - Negative externalities

Collective action problem:

- There are individual costs to pursuing this goal

- Gains from your individual contribution are minimal

- Why not enjoy the good, but not pay for it?

# Why Is Cooperation Difficult?

Environmental regulation can be costly

- Creates winners and losers (much like trade protection!)

- Costs of regulation tend to be highly concentrated

- Benefits are widely dispersed (we all enjoy a cleaner environment)

- Opponents of regulatory policies enjoy advantages in overcoming collective action problems

--

Scientific uncertainty (i.e. model prediction error)

- Predictions from scientific models become increasingly uncertain over large time ranges

- Uncertainty is exploited by different groups for political leverage

# Why Is Cooperation Difficult?

International sources conflict

- Developing countries argue that environmental regulation is biased in that they impose unfair costs on developing states

- Western countries were able to develop without worrying about environmental issues and are responsible for the largest quantities of emissions

- Developed countries are also better able (more capacity) to combat climate change

- Wealthier countries responsible for greater share of global emissions

# Why Is Cooperation Difficult?


Private-public solutions

Example: Cap and trade

- Sets a cap on total output / emissions of a given pollutant

- Companies can sell “credits” to other companies for pollution that they don’t produce

- This incentivizes cleaner technologies, as companies can profit from reduced emissions
