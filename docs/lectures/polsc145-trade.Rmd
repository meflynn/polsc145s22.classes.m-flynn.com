# Lecture Overview

1. What is trade?

2. Why trade?

3. Trade protection

4. Trade as a policy instrument

5. International institutions and trade



---
# Key Questions and Goals

1. What is the difference between absolute and comparative advantage?

2. What are factors of production and how do they determine what states trade?

3. Define protectionism and identify different types of protectionist policies

4. If trade is so beneficial, why do countries implement protectionist policies?

# What is Trade?



---
# What is Trade?

> **Trade**: The exchange of goods and services between individuals

Key points

- Trade occurs between individuals

- States don’t trade with one another, but we talk about them anyway



---
# What is Trade?

Lots of ways to think about trade:

- Total trade
- Exports
- Imports
- Sector or industry (technology sector, auto industry, etc.)
- Specific goods and items 
  - North American Industry Classification System Item #522390: Other Activities Related to Credit Intermediation. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in facilitating credit intermediation (except mortgage and loan brokerage; and financial transactions processing, reserve, and clearinghouse activities). Illustrative Examples: Check cashing services, Money order issuance services, Loan servicing, Travelers' check issuance services, Money transmission services, and Payday lending services.

# Why Trade?



---
# Why Trade?

Gains from trade

- Needs (Food, natural resources, etc.)

- Want (Silks, Foods, Playstations, etc.)

- Capacity to produce yourself (Try building your own Playstation).

- Specialization: You can export goods you’re good at making and import goods you’re bad at making



---
# Why Trade?

Trade not always viewed as a good thing

- Mercantilism

- Emphasis is on self-sufficiency 

- Trade can benefit / enrich adversaries

- Colonies

# Why Trade?

Comparative advantage

- People / countries should focus on relative strengths

- Does not mean you do it better than anyone else (i.e. Absolute advantage)

- Comparative advantage is about opportunity costs of production

# Why Trade?

Why do states produce what they do?

- States will produce what they can produce

- We must consider abundance and scarcity of factors of production

  - Land

  - Unskilled labor

  - Skilled labor (human capital)

  - Capital
  
  
  
  
---
# Why Trade?

Heckscher–Ohlin theory

- Countries will export goods that make intensive use of the factors that are abundant

- Countries will import goods that make intensive use of the factors that are scarce

# Trade Protection



---
# Trade Protection

If trade is so good why do we see people fighting against it?

What is trade protection?

> **Protectionism**: Policies aimed at protecting domestic industries, often by blocking competing imports from other countries or using subsidies to prop up domestic industries.

Examples include tariffs, quotas, subsidies



---
# Trade Protection

Motivation for protection

- Trade creates winners and losers

- Free trade can produce aggregate gains, but some groups will also be hurt

- National versus international markets and competition



---
# Trade Protection

Balance of Trade

- $$\text{Balance of Trade} = \text{Exports} – \text{Imports}$$

- Positive values represent a trade surplus

- Negative values represent a trade deficit

# Trade Protection

Does this actually mean the economy loses money? 

--

No, because there’s more to the economy than trade.

--

How we measure GDP:

$$GDP = Consumption + Investment + GovernmentSpending + (Exports - Imports)$$

--

But this is still a politically powerful idea used to mobilize broader support



---
# Trade Protection

Economic explanations for protectionism

**Stolper–Samuelson Theorem**

- Owners of the scarce factors of production in a country will support protection

- Assumes factors of production are mobile

**Ricardo–Viner Model**

- Support and opposition to free trade are linked to sector-specific interests

- Assumes that factors of production are immobile



---
# Trade Protection 

Policymakers’ perspectives

- Policymakers don’t represent the entire country

- Legislators represent distinct geographic and/or economic constituencies

- Protection is a way to provide benefits to those constituents
