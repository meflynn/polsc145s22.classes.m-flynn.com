# Motivations

What do we mean when we talk about social science?

- Science is not just a noun (i.e. a thing)

- It's a verb

- Science is a method of structuring inquiryâ€”it's the *way* we go about structuring our approach to research

- Emphasis on transparency, replicability, rigor, etc.



---
class: left, top

# Motivations

Our goals can vary depending on the question or problem

- Descriptive
- Causal
- Predictive

More broadly

- Produce generalizeable knowledge
- Solve interesting problems
- Improve the human condition
- Alleviate human suffering
- And more



---
class: left, top

# Motivations

Description

- We want to know what a thing actually looks like

- We want to know what the relationship between two things looks like

- Necessitates accurate measurement

- Examples:

  - How long do most wars last?
  - Are most countries in the world democracies, autocracies, or something else?
  
  

---
class: left, top

# Motivations

Causation

- The occurerence of one event/phenomena is the consequence of another

- Correlation does not equal causation (except when it does)

- Alternatively, causation does not necessarily equal (observable) correlation


???
# Notes

A good example here is pressing a gas pedal in a car. On a flat surface pressing the pedal clearly causes an observable increase in speed. But on an increasingly steep hill pressing down on the gas pedal will help you maintain a constant speed as the incline increases (assuming lots of other factors hold constant).

# Motivations

Predictive Analysis

- We want to understand variation in outcomes

- This often requires considering relationships between outcomes and multiple predictors

- Individual causal relationships don't always explain a ton of variation

# Motivations

Biasâ€”what is it?

- Not how we use the term in contemporary media/politics

- A more technical set of meanings, but most broadly...

> **Bias**: Systematic error of some sort that can affect our inferences and conclusions (Howard 2017, 151)



---
class: left, top

# Motivations

Lots of types of bias/names for bias

- Omitted variable bias
- Confounding
- Observation bias
- Social desirability bias
- Selection bias
- Selecting on the dependent variable
- Survivor bias
- Aggregation bias
- Ecological fallacy

# The Research Process

Theory

- Colloquial definition: A hunch or a guess that is similar to a hypothesis

> A logically consistent set of statements that explains a phenomenon of interest (FLS, xxix)



---
class: left, top

# The Research Process

Theories help us do a few things

1. Explain why something happens
2. Describe how things happen
3. Predict what will happen
4. Prescribe what we should do in a given situation




---
class: left, top

# The Research Process

Theories require simplification

- The world is really complex

- Theories help us to focus on the most essential and influential factors

- Implication: All theories are, as a rule, "wrong" or "inaccurate"

- But...
  - Is it useful? 
  - Does it help us to explain or understand something about the world? 
  - Does it advance upon previous theories? 
  - Does it generate clear expectations or implications?




---
class: left, top

# The Research Process

Theories and falsifiability

- We can never prove a theory "true"

- Much of what we deal with is probabilistic, not deterministic

- New events can always come along and create new data that will weaken or prove a theory wrong




---
class: left, top

# The Research Process

Organizing analysis

- It's hard

- Define the relevant actors

- How do we measure phenomena of interest?

- How do we structure our analysis?




---
class: left, top

# The Research Process

Actors

  - States
  - Individuals
  - Corporations
  - Groups
  - Factors of production (i.e. labor/capital)
  - Years
  - State-Year
  - Dyad-Year
  
  


---
class: left, top

# The Research Process

Actors

  - We often treat actors *as if* they are unitary (even when we know they're not)
  
  - Assumptions and simplications are necessary (otherwise we're not building a model)
  
  Examples:
    - Political Parties
    - Voting blocs
    - Governments
    
    


---
class: left, top

# The Research Process

Interests

  - What do actors want?
  
  - How do we conceptualize interests?
  
  - Rationality

$$X = \{X^i, X^{ii}, X^{iii}\}$$

$$X^i \geq X^{ii} \geq X^{iii}$$



---
class: left, top

# The Research Process

Institutions

- Rules that govern interactions between different actors

- The "rules of the game"

- Formal vs informal

- Enforcement



---
class: left, top

# The Research Process

Generating generalizable knowledge and inferences

- One observations is usually not sufficient

- We can't always identify causal relationships from casual inspection

- Often there are multiple causal factors

- Need variation in outcomes and predictors to assess general relationships




---
class: left, top

# The Research Process

Measurement

- We need some way to evaluate the relative frequency, intensity, gradations, etc., of phenomena of interest

- This means we have to **define** and **measure** the things we're interested in tracking across space and time

  - **Validity**: Is your measurement an appropriate proxy or operationalization of the underlying concept?

  - **Reliability**: Is your measurement scheme *consistently* capturing into the underlying concept?

- Even qualitative analysis require measurement schemes

Analyses and Evaluating Evidence

- Lots of different ways of doing this

- Case studies

- Observational studies

- Experimental research



---
class: left, top

# The Research Process

Case studies

- Rely on a small number of units (individuals, countries, groups, etc.)

- Collect more in-depth information about the units

- Try to identify causal effects and relationships using this information





---
class: left, top

# The Research Process

Observational studies

- Can take lots of different forms

- Often involves collecting lots of measurements of different variables for lots of different units

- Predictor variables are not under the control of the reseracher

- Attempt to design the study in such a way as to maximize validity, reduce, biases, etc.

# The Research Process

Experimental Studies

- Researcher control all (or almost all) of the treatment assignment

- The **treatment** is the predictor whose causal effect on the outcome is what we're trying to measure

- Researcher controls assignment so easier to reduce biases

# The Research Process

Experimental vs observational

- Experimental is "ideal" in lots of ways, but researchers often can't do this for a variety of reasons (e.g. ethical concerns, feasibility, etc.)

- Learning how to structure good observational studies is just as important as learning how to conduct a randomized controlled trial

# The Research Process

Conclusions and assessment

- Do the results match your expectations/support your hyothesis?

- Substantive significance?

- Statistical significance?

- Have you adjusted for potentially confounding factors?

- Are there multiple interpretations of the results?

- Is reformulating the theory necessary?

- What questions remain?

- What steps should future researchers take?
