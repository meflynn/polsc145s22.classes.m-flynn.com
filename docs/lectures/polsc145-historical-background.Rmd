1. What is a "state" and where did the modern state come from?

2. Identify factors that contributed to the growth of human settlements and uneven development across space and time.

3. Be able to define some of the key events that define each time period.

4. Identify the major actors driving events during each time period. 

5. How did finance, monetary policy, and conflict all relate to one another during these time periods?

# Origins of the Modern State

So what defines a nation-state? A few key characteristics:

- Functional differentiation
  - State consists of offices and emphasizes specializations
  - More efficient when someone specializes in something
  - Office is more important than a single person and persists beyond the current occupant
- State enjoys a monopoly on the use of violence within its territory (i.e. violence is public, not private)
- Territorial sovereignty

Lots of different ways to arrange and organize

- Democracies
- Autocracies
- Presidential systems
- Parliamentary systems
- Imperialist/non-imperial

# Origins of the Modern State

So what determines how and why people organize?

Lots of things:

- Biology (e.g. family relations, kin groups)
- Basic incentives for cooperation (Protection, division of labor, etc.)
- Technological adaptations (domestication of animals, agriculture, etc.)
- Force and violence 
- Geography

# Origins of the Modern State

Agricultural Revolution:

- Domestication of plants happens ~12,000 years ago
- Different peoples and regions begin developing agricultural systems at different times
- Hunter/gatherer and agriculture two strategies and develop alongside one another


---
class: left, top

# Origins of the Modern State

Domestication of Animals

- Begins around the same time with dogs (then sheep, goats, pigs, cows, and horses)
- Increases food supply (and it's renewable)
- Facilitates greater diversification and specialization of labor
- Food surpluses mean populations can grow more quickly
- Population can also congregate in one place
- Larger populations require more animals means more disease (e.g. flu, tuberculosis, malaria, plague, etc.)

# The Mercantilist Era

Overview

- The modern nation-state system is often traced to the **Peace of Westphalia in 1648**

> Peace of Westphalia: The settlement that ended the Thirty Years' War in 1648: Often said to have created the modern state system because it included a general recognition of the principles of sovereignty and nonintervention (FLS, 8).

- Focused mainly on Western Europe

- Intra-European competition preceeds this point in time, and persists long after

- Polities are scrambling to establish overseas colonies

class: top, left

# The Mercantilist Era

Who are the major players during this period?

- England

- France

- Spain

- Portugal

- The Netherlands (the Dutch)

# Notes

Note that most of these powers are all major sea powers. France is primarily known for its land army.

# The Mercantilist Era

But what **IS** Mercantilism?

> Mercantilism: An economic doctrine based on a belief that military power and economic influence were complements. Applied especially to colonial empires int he 16th through 18th centuries. Monopolies at the center of mercantilist trade policies favored the mother country over its colonies and over its competitors (FLS, 5)

# The Pax Britannica

What is the *Pax Britannica*?

- Literally, the "British Peace"

- Approximately 1815–1914, from the end of the Napoleonic Wars to the beginning of World War I

- Congress of Vienna:

  - Creates a post-war order in Europe
  
  - Emphasizes balance of power on the continent
  
  - France remains a continental power
  
  - Creates a system of consultation among European leaders
  
  - Partly rooted in fears of democratic revolutionaries

# Notes

How can trade be more than 100% of GDP?!

It's all in how we count: 

$$   GDP = \text{Private Consumption}_{it} + \text{Investment}_{it} + \text{Government Spending}_{it} + (\text{Exports}_{it} - \text{Imports}_{it})    $$

So if total trade (i.e. imports plus exports) is very large then it can exceed overall GDP. In the following example exports are huge, but so are imports, and together they total to 175 (i.e. total trade). 

Example: $$     100 = 25 + 25 + 25 + (100 - 75)      $$
