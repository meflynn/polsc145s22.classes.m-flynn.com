1. What is international finance?

2. Why do people invest abroad?

3. Controversy and conflict in international finance



---
# Key Questions and Goals

1. How does the Heckscher–Ohlin Theory help us to understand capital flows?

2. What sorts of political factors affect lending and borrowing decisions?

3. How do international financial flows relate to trade? To monetary policy?

# What is international finance?

Factors of production

- Land

- Unskilled labor

- Skilled labor (human capital)

- Capital



---
# What is international finance?

Finance

- Investment and the allocation of capital

- About the flow of money across borders

Monetary policy

- Concerns the valuation, supply, and manipulation of currency



---
# What is international finance?

Three main types of financial relations:

- Portfolio investment

- Sovereign lending

- Foreign direct investment (FDI)



---
# What is international finance?

Portfolio investment

- Buying stock (equity) in a foreign company

- Lending money to a foreign company or government (buying bonds)

- No control over investment (usually)




---
# What is international finance?

Sovereign lending

- Loans from private financial institutions to foreign governments (buying bonds)

- This is the biggest category of portfolio investment (a subset of portfolio investment)

- Debt



---
# What is international finance?

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)

- Investment by a company in one country into a foreign country

- Buying or investing in a subsidiary, opening a factory or branch

- Control over investment




---
# What is international finance?

Who are the relevant actors?

- States

- Individuals

- Firms

Defining debt relationships:

- Creditors: People who loan money

- Debtors: People who borrow money

# Why Invest Overseas?





---
# Why Invest Overseas?

Profit: To make (more) money

Heckscher–Ohlin theory

- Countries will export goods that make intensive use of the factors that are abundant

- Countries will import goods that make intensive use of the factors that are scarce




---
# Why Invest Overseas?

Holders of capital make money by investing it with the expectation of generating a return

Returns can take the form of:

- Access to cheap labor or foreign markets may also increase returns to investment

- Dividends, interest, appreciation, etc.




---
# Why Invest Overseas?

# Why Invest Overseas?

Demand within target state

Two general types:

- **Private**: Private interests in developing countries need capital to build, expand, and develop industry

- **Public**: Governments need to borrow money to finance public works projects, military capabilities, war, etc.

# Conflict and Controversy

Less Developed Countries (LDCs)

Borrow money to promote growth

- Infrastructure (roads, electric lines, etc.)

- Promote domestic startups

- Promote innovation

Increasing the size of the economy should increase government revenues.

# Conflict and Controversy

Heckscher-Ohlin framework doesn't explain all investment patterns

- Majority of international investment flows from developed countries to other developed countries

- Why?

--

Well, there are a few reasons...

- Investment, development, and growth strategies don't always work out (even if they're sensible)

- Governments sometimes expropriate investments and property

- Instability and conflict can disrupt production

- Higher interest rates are also due to risk (i.e. creditors charge more because of risks)

# Conflict and Controversy

Debt and conflict

-  Regardless of the issue, debts don't go away just because the borrower's situation has changed

- Think student loans, but less forgiving

Terms to know

- **Default**: Occurs when borrowers fail to make payments on their debts

- **Austerity**: Policies aimed at reducing consumption (spending) and assuring creditors. Often includes tax increases/decreases, raising interest rates, reduced government spending, and wage restrictions.





---
# Conflict and Controversy

The puzzle:

- Default and austerity hurt both borrowers and lenders

-  Why can't debtors and creditors restructure the terms of the loan? (e.g. repayment time, number of installments, interest rates, etc.)

After all, both sides have incentives to maintain good relations

- Creditors **need** borrowers to make profits

- Less-developed countries need access to foreign capital markets to finance growth, economic development, etc.





---
class: left, top

# Conflict and Controversy

Bargaining Problems

- Bargaining models can be useful in thinking about creditor-debtor relationships, too

- Debtors have incentives to misrepresent ability to pay to get better terms

- Creditors also have incentives to misrepresent what they can accept to get a better deal.  They can also retaliate by threatening to cut off access to funding.

- Credibility of each can be hard to establish (i.e. private information)

- FDI and multinational corporations have long been accused to exploiting various conditions in target states

- Poorer human rights conditions, lax labor protections, child labor, etc.

- Can exacerbate poor human rights conditions or incentivize governments to crack down on labor movements
