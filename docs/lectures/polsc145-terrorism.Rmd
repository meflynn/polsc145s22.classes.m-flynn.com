# Lecture Overview

1. Defining terrorism

2. Organization

3. Why terror?

4. Responding to terrorism



---
# Key Questions and Goals

1. Develop a better understanding of why groups choose terror tactics vs other tactics

2. Develop a better understanding of the factors that lead some groups to use terror tactics

3. Think about the different types of targets and audiences for terror attacks

4. Think about the causal mechanisms by which terror is expected to bring about policy change

# Defining Terrorism

How would you define terrorism?

What criteria would you include? (e.g. targets, violence, type of action, etc.)

List:

# Defining Terrorism

Terrorism is a label that is often used loosely, but it has more specific technical and legal definnitions

> **Terrorism**: The premeditated threat or use of violence against noncombatant targets by individuals or subnational groups to obtain a political or social objective through intimidation of a larger audience (FLS).



---
# Defining Terrorism

Let's break that down...

--

1. Premeditated

--

2. Threat OR use of violence

--

3. Perpetrators: Individuals O subnational groups

--

4. Targets: Non-combatants (immediate) and a larger audience (extended)

--

5. Goals: Various political, economic, and/or social goals




---
# Defining Terrorism

But what does this leave out?

- States and militaries as perpetrators?

- States and militaries as targets?

- Property as targets?



---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Organization





---
# Organization

Key Point: Terrorism is a **tactic**, not an identity

--

"Terrorist" is a label used to identify those who use terror as a tactic

--

Who cares? Why does this matter?

--

Because...

- Not all groups that use terror look alike
- Groups often fight using mixed strategies—important to understand who uses terror, when, and how 
- Legalities associated with who/what constitutes a legitimate enemy combatant
- Differentiating more routine acts of violence from terrorism



---
# Organization

Traditional military/paramilitary 

- Tamil Tigers
- Islamic State of Iraq and Syria

--

Networked Actors

- al Qaeda and affiliates
  - al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) (later Islamic State)
  - al Nusra Front (al Qaeda affiliate in Syria)
  - al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
  - al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb

--

Hybrid Groups

- Hezbollah
- Provisional Irish Republican Army/Sinn Fein




---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Tactics


---
# Tactics

So why do groups use terror?

- Power asymmetries

- Political power, representation, access (or lack thereof)

- Issue salience

- Broader support (or lack thereof)

# Tactics

Nature of the attacks

- Often seemingly random

- Small-scale (bombings, vehicles, shootings, knives, etc.)

- Fatalities are typically low

- Intended to instill fear
