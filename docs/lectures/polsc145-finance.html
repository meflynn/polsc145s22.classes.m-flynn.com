3. Controversy and conflict in international finance



---
# Key Questions and Goals

# What is international finance?

Factors of production

- Land

- Unskilled labor

- Skilled labor (human capital)

- Capital



---
# What is international finance?

Finance

- Investment and the allocation of capital

- About the flow of money across borders

Monetary policy

- Concerns the valuation, supply, and manipulation of currency



---
# What is international finance?

Three main types of financial relations:

- Portfolio investment

- Sovereign lending

- Foreign direct investment (FDI)



---
# What is international finance?

Portfolio investment

- Buying stock (equity) in a foreign company

- Lending money to a foreign company or government (buying bonds)

- No control over investment (usually)




---
# What is international finance?

Sovereign lending

- Loans from private financial institutions to foreign governments (buying bonds)

- This is the biggest category of portfolio investment (a subset of portfolio investment)

- Debt



---
# What is international finance?

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)

- Investment by a company in one country into a foreign country

- Buying or investing in a subsidiary, opening a factory or branch

- Control over investment




---
# What is international finance?

Who are the relevant actors?

- States

- Individuals

- Firms

Defining debt relationships:

- Creditors: People who loan money

- Debtors: People who borrow money

# Why Invest Overseas?





---
# Why Invest Overseas?

Profit: To make (more) money

Heckscher–Ohlin theory

- Countries will export goods that make intensive use of the factors that are abundant

- Countries will import goods that make intensive use of the factors that are scarce




---
# Why Invest Overseas?

Holders of capital make money by investing it with the expectation of generating a return

Returns can take the form of:

- Access to cheap labor or foreign markets may also increase returns to investment

- Dividends, interest, appreciation, etc.




---
# Why Invest Overseas?

Applying the Heckscher-Ohlin framework

Example #1: Abundant capital

- One borrower

- Multiple lenders

# Why Invest Overseas?

Applying the Heckscher-Ohlin framework

Example #1: Scarce capital

# Why Invest Overseas?

Demand within target state

Two general types:

- **Private**: Private interests in developing countries need capital to build, expand, and develop industry

- **Public**: Governments need to borrow money to finance public works projects, military capabilities, war, etc.

# Conflict and Controversy

# Conflict and Controversy

Less Developed Countries (LDCs)

Borrow money to promote growth

- Infrastructure (roads, electric lines, etc.)

- Promote domestic startups

- Promote innovation

Increasing the size of the economy should increase government revenues.

# Conflict and Controversy

.pull-left[
Private companies in developed economies do the same thing!

- Apple (AAPL)

- $124,719,000 in [total debt](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/balance-sheet/#:~:text=Total%20Debt,124%2C719%2C000) as of September 30, 2021

- Debt can be used for a variety of purposes, like research and development, acquiring subsidiaries, or acquiring new production capabilities.

# Conflict and Controversy

Heckscher-Ohlin framework doesn't explain all investment patterns

- Majority of international investment flows from developed countries to other developed countries

- Why?

--

Well, there are a few reasons...

- Investment, development, and growth strategies don't always work out (even if they're sensible)

- Governments sometimes expropriate investments and property

- Instability and conflict can disrupt production

- Higher interest rates are also due to risk (i.e. creditors charge more because of risks)

# Conflict and Controversy

.pull-left[
Example: Venezuela

- Hugo Chavez nationalized 1,162 companies between 2002 and 2012

- This means that the Venezuelan government took control of private property, many controlled by international firms

- This can make international firms and investors wary of doing business with certain governments

# Conflict and Controversy

Debt and conflict

-  Regardless of the issue, debts don't go away just because the borrower's situation has changed

- Think student loans, but less forgiving

Terms to know

- **Default**: Occurs when borrowers fail to make payments on their debts

- **Austerity**: Policies aimed at reducing consumption (spending) and assuring creditors. Often includes tax increases/decreases, raising interest rates, reduced government spending, and wage restrictions.





---
# Conflict and Controversy

The puzzle:

- Default and austerity hurt both borrowers and lenders

-  Why can't debtors and creditors restructure the terms of the loan? (e.g. repayment time, number of installments, interest rates, etc.)

After all, both sides have incentives to maintain good relations

- Creditors **need** borrowers to make profits

- Less-developed countries need access to foreign capital markets to finance growth, economic development, etc.

# Conflict and Controversy

Bargaining Problems

- Bargaining models can be useful in thinking about creditor-debtor relationships, too

- Debtors have incentives to misrepresent ability to pay to get better terms

- Creditors also have incentives to misrepresent what they can accept to get a better deal.  They can also retaliate by threatening to cut off access to funding.

- Credibility of each can be hard to establish (i.e. private information)

# Conflict and Controversy

.pull-left[
Human rights issues

- FDI and multinational corporations have long been accused to exploiting various conditions in target states

- Poorer human rights conditions, lax labor protections, child labor, etc.

- Can exacerbate poor human rights conditions or incentivize governments to crack down on labor movements

- But, human rights shaming campaigns can reduce FDI into targeted states
