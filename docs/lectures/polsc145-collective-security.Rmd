# Defining Collective Security

What are collective security institutions?

> Broad-based institutions that promote peace and security among their members (FLS)

Key points

- Broad-based

- Institutions

- **Among** member states



---
# Defining Collective Security


What are they designed to do?

- Promote peaceful resolution of disputes between member states

- Provide a structure and forum for routine communication and negotiation between states

- Deter and/or punish acts of aggression

# Current Status

## Purpose has changed over time

- Emphasis on interstate conflict remains, but...

- Conceptualization of security has broadened

  - Conflict within states
  
  - Human rights issues
  
  - Environmental and health issues
  
  
  
  
---
# Current Status

## UN activities include

- Peacekeeping missions
- International police missions
- Monitoring chemical and nuclear weapons
- Conflict mediation
- Humanitarian interventions
- Monitoring election integrity
- Monitoring and responding to global health crises




---
# Current Status

## UN Organization

- Security Council
  - Five permanent members (US, UK, France, Russia, China)
  - 10 temporary members
  - Decisions require unanimous consent of permanent members and majority of temporary members
- General Assembly
  - Consists of all UN member states
  - Representatives routinely meet to discuss global issues
- Subsidiary agencies
  - Specialize in monitoring particular issues
  - Collect and disseminate information from/to member countries
  - Conduct inspections, aid in enforcement
  - Examples include World Health Organization, International Atomic Energy Agency, etc.

# Interventions

## Why does the UN intervene?

- Conflicts between states

- Conflicts within states

- Conditioning factors

  - Do major powers have strong interests?
  - Do regional powers have strong interests?
  - How big and/or complex is the conflict?

## Is peacekeeping effective?

It depends

- Peace enforcement is less effective

- Peacekeeping has a higher success rate

- Selection effects?
