# Lecture Overview

1. The purpose of war
2. Breaking down the state
3. Thinking about interests and war
4. Institutions and war



---

# Key Questions and Goals

1. What is the purpose of war?
2. How do different societal groups influence policy?
3. What are examples of "interest groups"?
4. What is the "rally" effect?
5. Describe the ways in which institutions can affect the likelihood of conflict?

# The Purpose of War



---
# The Purpose of War?

War—what is it good for?

- Two conceptualizations:

  - War serves the national interest
  
  - War serves interests of more narrow social groups
  
  
  
---
# The Purpose of War?

War and the national Interest

- War advances or preserves broad, shared interests

- War is for the "common good"

- We can think of broad concepts like "national security", "national defense", etc.



---
# The Purpose of War?
  
War and narrow interests

- War advances or preserves more narrow, particularistic interests

- These are interests of a more specific subset of the population

- But who?

  - Industries
  - Lobbies
  - Economy

# Breaking Down the State



---
# Breaking Down the State

We talk a lot about the "state", but who are we really talking about?

- Realist or higher level theories often treat states as unitary actors, but reality is obviously more complex

- States are composed of some key groups

  - Leaders
  - Bureaucrats
  - Interest Groups
  - General Public
  
  

---
# Breaking Down the State

Leaders

- Heads of state
- Heads of government
- Legislators
- Policymakers
- Bureaucrats



---
# Breaking Down the State

Bureaucrats

- Aids and advisers to heads of state/government
- Policymakers within larger organizations (e.g. State, DoD, etc.)
- Military personnel
- Diplomats



---
# Breaking Down the State

Interest Groups

- Businesses
- Labor groups
- Military personnel
- Government workers
- Religious and/or ethnic groups
- Human rights organizations





---
# Breaking Down the State

General Public

- You
- You
- You
- You
- You
- You
- You
- And, you
- You
- You, too

# Interests and War



---
# Interests and War

Whose interests does war serve?

--

It depends

We first have to understand what groups want

--

So what *do* these actors want?

--

Well, we have to make some assumptions:

- Policymakers: To stay in office
- Interest groups: To advance their organizational interests (money, budgets, etc.)
- General public: ¯\ \_(ツ)\_/¯ 




---
# Interests and War

The Rally Effect

- The use of military force can raise nationalistic sentiments

- This can be in response to an attack or as a result of initiating conflict

- This may give leaders a boost in public support

# Interests and War

Diversionary Incentive

- Leaders want to remain in office but may have limited policy tools available

- Because leaders are aware of the rally effect, they have an incentive to use military force to remedy political problems

- "Gambling for resurrection"

- Various conditions might incentivize such behavior

  - High unemployment
  - High inflation
  - Civil unrest
  - Political scandals

# Interests and War

Reasons to be skeptical

- Arbenz implemented many worker-friendly policies

- Cold War made Western governments very wary of anything remotely resembling Communism

- US intervened in many other countries where such strong ties did not exist




---

# Interests and War

The Military

- Maintain edge over potential threats and peer competitors 

- Training and role predispose military leaders to see military solutions to problems

- Makes organization relevant



---

# Interests and War

Reasons to be skeptical

- Evidence indicates prior military experience makes policymakers (in US) less likely to initiate the use of force

- No evidence that military leaders can use positions to substantially influence spending decisions

# Regime Type and War


Classical Liberal Theory

- Democracy should curb belligerent behavior

  - Elections
  
  - Separation of powers
  
  - Norms
  
- Empirical evidence shows reality is more complicated

# Regime Type and War

What is democracy?

> A political system in which candidates compete for political office through frequent, fair elections in which a sizeable portion of the adult population can vote (FLS)




---

# Regime Type and War


Non-Democracies (everything else)

> **Autocracies**: In mature form, autocracies sharply restrict or suppress competitive political participation. Their chief executives are chosen in a regularized process of selection within the political elite, and once in office they exercise power with few institutional constraints (Polity IV Project Codebook, 15)

> **Anocracy**: Regimes that exhibit a mixture of democratic and autocratic characteristics

# Regime Type and War

Selectorate Theory

- Society

- Selectorate

- Winning Coalition



---
# Regime Type and War

Balance between public and private goods

- Small winning coalitions provide more private goods

- Larger winning coalitions provide more public goods

- War and its spoils can be thought of as private good

- Costs of war not incurred by the winning coalition

- To put it differently, benefits of war are concentrated and costs are diffuse

# Regime Type and War

Empirical evidence shows us that

- Democracies fight as much as non-democracies 

- Democracies tend to fight with non-democracies

- Mature democracies don't fight one another

- States in transition to democracy may be more belligerent

- Democracies tend to win the fights they get into

- Single-party autocracies intiate conflict at about the same rate as democracies. Constraining effect.
