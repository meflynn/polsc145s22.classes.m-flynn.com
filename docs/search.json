As one of the three main subfields in political science,\r\ninternational relations evolved as the study of nation-states and their\r\ninteractions in the global sphere. Over the past several centuries the\r\ntype and frequency of these interactions, along with the range of actors\r\ninvolved, have increased exponentially.

Accordingly, this course will focus on basic facts and key\r\nconcepts related to the study of international relations. We will also\r\nfocus on how to analyze the casual processes underpinning events of\r\ninterest.\r\nCourse Objectives\r\nDevelop an understanding of some of the key issues in world\r\npolitics.\r\nIdentify some of the most important actors as they relate to these\r\nkey issues.\r\nDevelop an understanding of evidence-based research as it relates to\r\nthese issues and actors:\r\nDevelop an understanding of the relationship between observation,\r\ntheory, evidence, and analysis.\r\nIdentify questions, problems, or puzzles in world politics.\r\nThink about how we can develop theoretical models to help us analyze\r\nthese issues.\r\nThink about how we can structure research to analyze these\r\nquestions.\r\nThink about how we can collect different types of data to help us\r\nanswer these questions.\r\nThink about how we can evaluate evidence to draw conclusions and\r\ngenerate insights.\r\n\r\nLearn to think about issues in world politics in terms of\r\ncorrelation, causation, and evidence.\r\nCourse Format\r\nThe course will be primarily lecture, thought students are encouraged\r\nto participate and ask questions where appropriate. I encourage students\r\nto ask questions if the readings of lecture materials are unclear and to\r\nreach out if they need help. In addition to class lectures students will\r\nbe responsible for keeping up with readings and other class-related\r\nmaterial as the semester progresses.\r\nCovid-19 Planning and\r\nContingencies\r\nAs you may have noticed, we’re still in the middle of a pandemic. The\r\nOmicron variant spreads much easier and more quickly than earlier\r\nvariants. We have three primary tools to help us continue in-person\r\ninstruction, because, frankly, online learning isn’t fun for anyone:\r\nVaccination\r\nMasking\r\nVentilation\r\nVaccines: Vaccination remains our best option to\r\nhelp prevent the spread of, and mitigate the worst effects of, COVID-19.\r\nI will not ask your vaccination status at any point, but I strongly urge\r\nstudents who are not currently vaccinated and who are able to talk to\r\nyour physicians about getting vaccinated. It’s safe, effective, and\r\nfree. You can find information and/or make an appointment at Lafene Health\r\nCenter, The Riley\r\nCounty Health Department, local pharmacies, or your primary care\r\nphysician.\r\nMasks: All students are expected to comply with\r\nK-State’s face mask policy. As of August 2, 2021, everyone must wear\r\nface masks over their mouths and noses in all indoor spaces on\r\nuniversity property, including while attending in-person classes. This\r\npolicy is subject to change at the university’s discretion. This also\r\nmeans no eating or drinking in class.\r\nTo state the obvious, this includes students attending lectures. Also\r\nplease note that some masks are better than others—N95, KN95, FFP2, and\r\nsimilar types of masks offer strong protection against transmission (for\r\nexample, see here\r\nand here).\r\nGaiters also don’t offer as much protection as higher quality masks.\r\nFace shields do effectively nothing on their own. You can find more\r\ninformation here\r\non Emergency Use Authorizations for various mask types,\r\nVentilation: In addition to personal preventative\r\nmeasures, ventilation and air filtration are enormously important in\r\nhelping to reduce individuals’ exposure to the virus. K-State has\r\nconducted a review of campus rooms over the last year to determine which\r\nrooms needed upgrades to their ventilation systems to ensure proper air\r\nflow.\r\nA Personal Note: I and my spouse are fully\r\nvaccinated, but we have two children under the age of 12 (including one\r\nnewborn) who are currently ineligible for the vaccine. Given that the\r\nsituation is continuously evolving, I appreciate everyone’s help in\r\nminimizing the risks to my family, and any members of your families, who\r\nmay be more vulnerable.\r\nModality Changes\r\nSo what happens if we have to revert back to remote learning because\r\nof COVID? Ultimately my goal is to structure the course in a way to\r\npreserve our flexibility to the fullest extent possible. If we are\r\nforced to move back to online instruction I will provide regular\r\nvideo-based lectures for students and will continue to be available\r\nthrough Zoom to hold office hours meetings\r\nRequired Readings\r\nFriden, Lake, and Schultz\r\n(2021)\r\nAdditional Readings\r\nStudents should also make an effort to stay informed on current\r\nevents. Below are a some examples of good sources for keeping up with\r\nglobal events. Please note that some of these publications may be\r\npay-walled, but you should have access through the university\r\nlibrary.\r\nBBC News\r\nThe Monkey\r\nCage\r\nPolitical Violence @ a\r\nGlance\r\nForeign Affairs\r\nForeign Policy Magazine\r\nThe Washington Post\r\nThe New York Times\r\nThe Economist\r\nThe Financial Times\r\nCourse Requirements\r\nExams: 70%: Your grade will largely be\r\ndetermined by a series of four tests. These are designed to assess your\r\nknowledge of basic ideas and concepts that we will cover throughout the\r\ncourse. All tests will be open book/note, and will be administered\r\nonline. They will cover material from the text book, in-class lectures,\r\ndiscussions, podcasts, and additional assigned readings. For each test\r\nyou will have 75 minutes to answer $$35 questions. There is no separate\r\nmid-term or final exams.\r\nWeekly Homework: 30%: You will have routine\r\nhomework assignments that are designed to provide you with exposure to\r\nthe course material prior to lectures. These assignments correspond to\r\neach chapter/subject found in the textbook. Students can continue to\r\nwork on each assignment after they initially complete it in order to\r\nmaximize their grade and better familiarize themselves with the subject\r\nmatter. However, grades are only updated until the due date posted on\r\nCanvas. After this date students can continue working on a given\r\nexercise after the due date, but the grades will be locked in at their\r\nvalues at the time of the due date.\r\nClassroom Policies\r\nBe kind. This might seem like an odd thing to list first, but I\r\nwant to emphasize that this is not a normal class environment—this is a\r\ntime of unparalleled stress for many of us. We’re still in the middle of\r\na global pandemic, many of us are still very much worried about our own\r\nhealth and safety, and many of us are very much worried about the health\r\nand safety of our coworkers, friends, and families. Zoom fatigue is also\r\na thing, so please be patient with one another. Let’s try to be\r\ncognizant of the fact that many of us (if not all) are going to be\r\nstruggling at various points, and let’s work together to make this\r\nsemester as educational and enjoyable as possible.\r\nBe professional. While we don’t have a traditional classroom\r\nenvironment this semester, please try to treat your interactions with\r\neveryone as professionally as you would during a normal on-campus\r\nexperience. This includes not watching TV or playing video games when\r\nyou are video conferencing with the instructor or your classmates.\r\nEveryone’s living situation may look a little different this year, and\r\nthere may be certain things that we can’t control about our\r\nenvironments, but let’s do what we can to respect one another during our\r\nshared time.\r\nStudy guides and extra credit. The class is the study guide. I do\r\nnot offer extra credit.\r\nGrade Appeals. If you believe that I have given you an incorrect\r\ngrade on an exam, you may submit a written appeal. All appeals must be\r\nin writing (they may not be made in person) and must contain an\r\nexplanation for why the grade is incorrect. I will also require you to\r\nwait 24 hours after receiving a grade to submit a written appeal. Please\r\nnote that even if your appeal is granted, I reserve the right to regrade\r\nthe assignment in its entirety, meaning that your grade may go up or\r\ndown depending on my reevaluation of the assignment.\r\nThe Syllabus. The syllabus is a living document that can and will\r\nbe altered throughout the duration of the course based both on need and\r\ndesign. Generally, this may mean readings will be removed or added as\r\nneeded. All changes will be listed on K-State Online, so make sure to\r\ncheck announcements for any such change. Additionally, I maintain the\r\nright to all of my own intellectual property presented in this course,\r\nwhether it is the course lectures or this syllabus. Materials from this\r\ncourse ought not to be reproduced without my expressed\r\npermission.\r\nClassroom conduct. All student activities in the University,\r\nincluding this course, are governed by the Student Judicial Conduct Code\r\nas outlined in the Student Governing Association By Laws, Article V,\r\nSection 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the\r\nlearning environment may be asked to leave the class.\r\nAcademic Honesty and\r\nPlagiarism\r\nAll work turned in as a part of this class must be original.\r\nKansas State University has an Honor & Integrity System based on\r\npersonal integrity which is presumed to be sufficient assurance in\r\nacademic matters one’s work is performed honestly and without\r\nunauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by\r\nregistration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor Integrity\r\nSystem. The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all\r\nfull and parttime students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate\r\ncourses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning.\r\nA component vital to the Honor & Integrity System is the\r\ninclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments,\r\nexaminations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor\r\nPledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: “On my honor, as a\r\nstudent, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this\r\nacademic work.”\r\nThe default in this class is that ALL work will be accomplished\r\nindividually, UNLESS my permission is given in advance of an\r\nassignment/quiz/exam/take-home exam/final. If you are in doubt, please\r\nask.\r\nA grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F\r\nindicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor\r\nPledge violation.\r\nFor more information, visit the Honor & Integrity System home\r\nweb page. All work is expected to adhere to the standards outlined\r\nby the Kansas State University Handbook. All written work is subject to\r\nonline plagiarism checks and will be required for all reaction papers as\r\nwell as the final paper. Any cases of plagiarism will receive an\r\nautomatic failure for the assignment, possible failure in the course,\r\nand will be pursued further through the university for additional\r\npunishment.\r\nThe Kansas State University Handbook (2008, Appendix F) defines\r\nplagiarism as follows:\r\n\r\nPlagiarism is taking credit for someone else’s ideas, work, or words.\r\nIn a university setting, it means submitting academic, scholarly, or\r\nliterary work in which you either claim or imply the material to be your\r\nown, when that is not the case.\r\n\r\nThe Handbook also provides examples of plagiarism, and steps students\r\ncan take to avoid it:\r\n[P]lagiarism could include:\r\nBuying a term paper, or copying another person’s paper, even if she\r\nor he gives you permission.\r\nCutting and pasting information from the internet into your own\r\npaper without properly identifying it as a quotation and properly\r\nattributing the source.\r\nUsing someone else’s concept and presenting it as if it is your own\r\noriginal creativity, without acknowledging the source of the idea.\r\nWhile some acts of plagiarism are obvious attempts to deceive, like\r\nbuying a term paper, others result from sloppy scholarship or failure to\r\nfollow proper format for crediting sources. For example:\r\nIf you copy directly from another source and acknowledge it in your\r\nbibliography or list of works cited, yet fail to put it in quotation\r\nmarks, this is plagiarism. The reason is that, although you have\r\nindicated that the idea is someone else’s, the lack of quotation marks\r\nimplies that the words are your own.\r\nParaphrasing is summarizing a source so that you have rewritten the\r\nmaterial in your own words but maintained the original author’s ideas.\r\nWhen you paraphrase, you do not need to put the words in quotation\r\nmarks, but you do need to properly attribute the original source.\r\nParaphrasing does not mean simply changing one or two words, or leaving\r\nout a sentence, while the rest remains the same. Even if you identify\r\nthe original author, but have used faulty paraphrasing that retains too\r\nmuch of the original, the result is inadvertent plagiarism.\r\nIf you use another researcher’s specific methodology, you should\r\nacknowledge doing so. While some research protocols are widespread and\r\ngeneral enough to need no citation, if the protocol, analysis, or\r\ntechnique can be attributed to a specific publication it should be\r\ncited.\r\nWorks of visual art and design, and images of the work, cannot be\r\nmisrepresented as original work by another. Such images cannot be used\r\nin part or whole without permission of the artist.\r\nAlso note that using papers previously written for another assignment\r\nin this, or in any other class, without the express permission of the\r\nprofessor is grounds for failing an assignment. Using your own material\r\nin this way, and not citing it, is also technically plagiarism and can\r\nbe treated as such. If you have concerns regarding any of these issues\r\nplease do not hesitate to contact me.\r\nStatement\r\nRegarding Wearing of Face Coverings\r\nTo protect the health and safety of the K-State community, students,\r\nfaculty, staff and visitors must wear face coverings over their mouths\r\nand noses while on K-State campuses in all hallways, public spaces,\r\nclassrooms and other common areas of campus buildings, and when in\r\noffices or other work spaces or outdoor settings when 6-feet social\r\ndistancing cannot be maintained. In addition, all students, faculty, and\r\nstaff are required to take the COVID-19 and Face Mask Safety training.\r\nEmployees who need reasonable accommodations and assistance related to\r\nrequired face coverings may contact the ADA coordinator at charlott@k-state.edu, and students\r\nneeding accommodations may contact the Student Access Center at accesscenter@k-state.edu.\r\nIn classrooms, faculty have the right to deny a student entry into\r\nthe room if the student is not wearing a face covering. Students not\r\nwearing a face covering will be reminded to do so and offered a clean\r\nface covering, if one is available. If the student does not comply, the\r\nfaculty member will ask the student to leave the space, and if\r\navailable, join the class remotely. As a last resort, campus police will\r\nbe called. The faculty members will complete the Code of Conduct form\r\nand the Office of Student Life will look further into the issue and take\r\nthe non-compliance with the request to leave into consideration of\r\nfurther accountability measures.\r\nAt no point should the professor or other students put themselves\r\ninto an unsafe situation while attempting to enforce the face-covering\r\npolicy. Manhattan campus police: 785-532-6412\r\nCitation and Style\r\nAll written work is expected to adhere to professional standards. As\r\ndescribed above, citing previous work is key. If you have any questions\r\nregarding the appropriate citation style please consult the American\r\nPolitical Science Association style guide.\r\nStudents with Disabilities\r\nStudents with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access\r\nto technology, or information about emergency building/campus evacuation\r\nprocesses should contact the Student Access Center and/or their\r\ninstructor. Services are available to students with a wide range of\r\ndisabilities including, but not limited to, physical disabilities,\r\nmedical conditions, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder,\r\ndepression, and anxiety. If you are a student enrolled in campus/online\r\ncourses through the Manhattan or Olathe campuses, contact the Student\r\nAccess Center at accesscenter@k-state.edu,\r\n785-532-6441; for Salina campus, contact the Academic and Career\r\nAdvising Center at acac@k-state.edu, 785-826-2649.\r\nIf you have any special conditions or needs that will affect your\r\nability to complete the required assignments outlined herein, please\r\ncontact the instructor as soon as possible to discuss your needs. I am\r\nhappy to help you in any way that I can. With advance notice\r\naccommodations can be made prior to deadlines and tests. Please note,\r\nhowever, that special consideration will not be granted afterwards as a\r\nmeans of addressing a grade you do not like.\r\nContacting the Instructor\r\nThe best way to get in touch with me is through email.
