## Course Summary
 
This course is designed to give undergraduate students an introduction to the topics and methods associated
with the study of world politics. As one of the three main subfields in political science, international
relations evolved as the study of nation-states and their interactions in the global sphere. Over the past
several centuries the type and frequency of these interactions, along with the range of actors involved, have
increased exponentially. Given that global political and economic events are increasingly relevant for individuals
around the world, it is imperative that we develop a solid foundation for understanding the actors,
incentives, and processes that drive these events. Accordingly, this course will focus on basic facts and key
concepts related to the study of international relations. We will also focus on how to analyze the casual
processes underpinning events of interest.

## Course Objectives

1. Develop an understanding of some of the key issues in world politics.
2. Identify some of the most important actors as they relate to these key issues.
3. Develop an understanding of evidence-based research as it relates to these issues and actors:
   - Develop an understanding of the relationship between observation, theory, evidence, and analysis.
   - Identify questions, problems, or puzzles in world politics.
   - Think about how we can develop theoretical models to help us analyze these issues.
   - Think about how we can structure research to analyze these questions.
   - Think about how we can collect different types of data to help us answer these questions.
   - Think about how we can evaluate evidence to draw conclusions and generate insights.
4. Learn to think about issues in world politics in terms of correlation, causation, and evidence.
