# Lecture Overview

1. Defining civil wars (revisisted)

2. Why do we see civil wars?

3. Bargaining problems

4. Strategies



---
# Key Questions and Goals

1. Be able to recognize some of the issues and challenges that make civil wars different from inter-state wars

2. What factors motivate individuals to rebel against their governments?

3. How do geographic and spatial factors affect mobilization, onset, and duration of civil wars?

# Defining Civil Wars

> **Civil War**: A war in which the main participants are within the same state, such as the government and a rebel group.

You can also call these intrastate wars.

# Bargaining Problems

## Bargaining in Civil Wars

Basic problems resemble those in interstate wars

Sources of bargaining failure

- Private/incomplete information

- Commitment problems

- Issue indivisibility

Civil wars have features that can exacerbate these issues




---
# Bargaining Problems

Civil Wars often characterized by power asymmetries

Incentivizes insurgencies over traditional maneuver battle

- Small units

- Often blend in with civilian population

- Lightly armed

- Harassment

- Hit and run attacks

- Terrorism
