1. What are human rights?

2. What factors affect respect for human rights?

3. Has government respect for human rights improved?

# Key Questions

1. What are the historical roots of the contemporary human rights regime?

2. How do the types of rights violated change across regime type and income levels?

3. What role do non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play in the global human rights regime?

# What Are Human Rights?

Think of human rights in two ways:

- First: A broad conceptual definition

>**Human Rights**: The rights possessed by all individuals by virtue of being human, regardless of their status as citizens of particular states or members of a group or organization (FLS).

- Second: More specific legal definitions and provisions that represent efforts to protect and respect particular types of activities (we'll get into those shortly.

UNDHR followed up by several treaties

- “Hard law”

- Though most states agree on UNDHR, specific treaties are more contentious due to binding nature

# What Are Human Rights?

Physical Integrity Rights

.medium[
> **Torture**: Purposeful inflicting of extreme pain, whether mental or physical, by government officials or by private individuals at the instigation of government officials

> **Political Imprisonment**: The incarceration of people by government officials because of: their speech; non-violent opposition to government policies or leaders; religious beliefs; non-violent religious practices including proselytizing; or their membership in a group, including an ethnic or racial group

>**Extrajudicial Killings**: Killings by government officials without due process of law. They include murders by private groups if instigated by the government. These killings may result from the deliberate, illegal, and excessive use of lethal force by the police, security forces, or other agents of the state whether against criminal suspects, detainees, prisoners, or others.

> **Disappearance**: Cases in which people have disappeared, political motivation appears likely, and the victims have not been found. Knowledge of the whereabouts of the disappeared is, by definition, not public knowledge. However, while there is typically no way of knowing where victims are, it is typically known by whom they were taken and under what circumstances.
