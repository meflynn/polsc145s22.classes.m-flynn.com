# Notes

On April 19, 1945, a freight train with nearly 4,500 prisoners from Buchenwald pulled onto the railroad siding at Nammering. The train had been destined for Dachau, but at Plattling it was diverted towards Nammering because of damage to the railroad caused by Allied bombing. Once in Nammering, some of the local inhabitants attempted to give the prisoners food and water, but these provisions were stolen by the 150 SS and police officers guarding the train. The commanding officer in charge, Lieutenant Hans Meerbach, ordered during the halt that the bodies of the dead be removed from the train and cremated. This work proceeded too slowly for him, however, and prisoners were forced to carry the bodies of the dead to a nearby mass grave in a ravine roughly 500 yards from the train. There the prisoners carrying the corpses were shot by the guards and they were also buried in the grave. Altogether 524 prisoners were shot and nearly 800 were interred in the mass grave. The bodies were then covered with lime and the grave was flooded to speed up decomposition. Those 3,100 prisoners who had remained on the train were sent on to Dachau, where they were liberated. After the discovery of the site by U.S. troops on April 28, the ranking American officer in the area forced SS men collected from a nearby POW camp to exhume the corpses and lay them out on either side of the ravine above the mass grave. The inhabitants of Nammering were then ordered to walk through the gravesite, and the bodies were buried in the surrounding towns of Eging am See, Aicha vom Wald, Nammering, and Fuerstenstein.

# Defining War



---
class: left, top

# Defining War

Why do we need a definition?

- "War" presupposes a condition that is "not War"

- "Conflict" is a very broad concept

- It can include both violent and non-violent interactions

- It can be political and non-political

- It can be one-on-one or involve the mobilization of millions of people

- So how do we isolate the specific types of events that make a war a war?



---
class: left, top

# Defining War

A couple of definitions

> **FLS**: An event involving the organized use of military force by at least two parties that satisfies some minimum threshold of severity 

> **Correlates of War (COW)**: Sustained combat involving organized armed forces resulting in a minimum of 1,000 battle-related combatant fatalities within a 12-month period. Must also meet effective resistence criteria.

# Defining War

What are we leaving on the table?

- War captures a particular type of conflict—not all conflict

- Definitions and measurement ultimately involve choices

- Those choices determine what we include/exclude

- Excluding some things doesn't necessarily mean we don't care about them

# Analytical Approaches to Studying War

There are different ways we can approach the subject to understand why, where, and when war occurs

Levels of analysis:

- Individual

- State

- System



---
class: left, top

# Analytical Approaches to Studying War

.pull-left[
Individual-level explanations

- Human nature (People are just violent)

- Bad people (Do bad things)
]

--

.pull-right[
Criticisms

- Why do some good people go to war?

- Why do some really bad people *not* go to war?

- Ignores broader social, economic, and political forces
]

class: left, top

# Analytical Approaches to Studying War

.pull-left[
State-level explanations

- Characteristics of individual units determine behavior

- Regime type

- Economic development

- Trade
]

--

.pull-right[
Criticisms

- Often ignores broader environmental factors

- Structural/constant factors cannot explain variation

- Ignores individual and behavioral explainations 

- Often ignores subnational variation (i.e. changing parties in government, social movements, etc.)
]

class: left, top

# Analytical Approaches to Studying War

.pull-left[
System-level explanations

- Individual parts do not explain outcomes

- Structure of the overall system matters more

  - Anarchy
  
  - Distribution/balance of power
  
  - Blocs of states
]

--

.pull-right[
Criticisms

- How do you study a system without reference to its parts?

- In effect this approach is still dealing with individual states

- Normative objections: Do we hold leaders accountable for their decisions if they're just responding to structural incentives and forces?
