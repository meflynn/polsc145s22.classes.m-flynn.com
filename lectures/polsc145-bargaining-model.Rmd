class: left, top

# Key Questions and Goals

1. What does it mean when we refer to the "puzzle" of war?

2. What are the three sources of bargaining failure?

3. How can states seek to communicate or signal things like resolve?

4. How does the bargaining model build on previous ways of thinking about war?

class: left, top

# The Puzzle of War

Why do states go to war?

- War is very costly

  - Militaries are expensive

  - Lots of suffering

- Opportunity costs

- War can also be highly unpredictable



---
class: left, top

# The Puzzle of War

More specifically

> Given that war is incredibly costly for both sides, why can't states negotiate a settlement that leaves both sides better off?

# Conceptualizing War

Mexican-American War (1846-1848)

- US offered Mexico $35 million in cash and debt forgiveness (about \$800 million + in constant dollars)

- US Paid \$15 million after the war

- Cost of war to US: $\sim$ $100 million; 13,000+ deaths

- Cost of war to Mexico: $\sim$ 25,000 dead; large economic losses

# Sources of Bargaining Failure

class: left, top

# Sources of Bargaining Failure

Three primary reason bargaining fails

1. Private/incomplete information

2. Commitment problems

3. Issue indivisibility




---
class: left, top

# Sources of Bargaining Failure

Private or Incomplete information

- More information about your own position than your opponent's

- Unknown, or hard to know, variables that may include:

  - Capabilities
  
  - Resolve
  
- Leads to poor estimates of essential factors

Private Incomplete Information

- Why not just tell your opponent? 

- Credibility

- Big incentives to bluff

# Sources of Bargaining Failure

Commitment Problems

- Can states agree to a deal and not try to renegotiate or make additional demands in the future?

- Some bargaining arrangements necessarily widen power disparities

- Other deals are made against the backdrop of changing power dynamics




---
class: left, top

# Sources of Bargaining Failure

Issue Indivisibility

- Can all goods be divided?

- Does dividing a good destroy its value?

- Indivisibility implies impossibility of compromise

- Skepticism

  - Incentives to bluff
  
  - Is physical partition the only solution?
