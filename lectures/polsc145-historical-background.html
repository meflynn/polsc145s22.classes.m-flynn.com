Lots of people, how to organize?

- Individual

- Chiefdoms, tribes, and clans
- Cities
- City-states and Kingdoms
- Empires
- Nation-states

# Origins of the Modern State

So what defines a nation-state? A few key characteristics:

- Functional differentiation
  - State consists of offices and emphasizes specializations
  - More efficient when someone specializes in something
  - Office is more important than a single person and persists beyond the current occupant
- State enjoys a monopoly on the use of violence within its territory (i.e. violence is public, not private)
- Territorial sovereignty

Lots of different ways to arrange and organize

- Democracies
- Autocracies
- Presidential systems
- Parliamentary systems
- Imperialist/non-imperial

# Origins of the Modern State

So what determines how and why people organize?

Lots of things:

- Biology (e.g. family relations, kin groups)
- Basic incentives for cooperation (Protection, division of labor, etc.)
- Technological adaptations (domestication of animals, agriculture, etc.)
- Force and violence 
- Geography






---
class: left, top

# Origins of the Modern State

Agricultural Revolution:

- Domestication of plants happens ~12,000 years ago
- Different peoples and regions begin developing agricultural systems at different times
- Hunter/gatherer and agriculture two strategies and develop alongside one another


---

# Origins of the Modern State

Domestication of Animals

- Begins around the same time with dogs (then sheep, goats, pigs, cows, and horses)
- Increases food supply (and it's renewable)
- Facilitates greater diversification and specialization of labor
- Food surpluses mean populations can grow more quickly
- Population can also congregate in one place
- Larger populations require more animals means more disease (e.g. flu, tuberculosis, malaria, plague, etc.)

Geography also matters

- Determines where people travel, hunt, settle, farm, etc.
- Determines the availability of flora and fauna
- Determines how plentiful supporting infrastructure can be
- Also determines the supply of diseases

# The Mercantilist Era



---
class: top, left

# The Mercantilist Era

Overview

- The modern nation-state system is often traced to the **Peace of Westphalia in 1648**

&gt; Peace of Westphalia: The settlement that ended the Thirty Years' War in 1648: Often said to have created the modern state system because it included a general recognition of the principles of sovereignty and nonintervention (FLS, 8).

- Focused mainly on Western Europe

- Intra-European competition preceeds this point in time, and persists long after

- Polities are scrambling to establish overseas colonies




---
class: top, left

# The Mercantilist Era

Who are the major players during this period?

- England

- France

- Spain

- Portugal

- The Netherlands (the Dutch)


???
# Notes

Note that most of these powers are all major sea powers. France is primarily known for its land army.

# The Mercantilist Era

But what **IS** Mercantilism?

&gt; Mercantilism: An economic doctrine based on a belief that military power and economic influence were complements. Applied especially to colonial empires int he 16th through 18th centuries. Monopolies at the center of mercantilist trade policies favored the mother country over its colonies and over its competitors (FLS, 5)

Examples of mercantilist policies:

- Colonialism

- Monopolies

- Restrictions on trade

  - Tariffs

# Notes
  
The writings of Adam Smith are a direct response to this time period.

# The Mercantilist Era

End of the Mercantilist Era

- United States emerges as an independent nation in 1783

- French Revolution begins in 1789

- Napoleon rises to power, then defeated in 1815 at Waterloo

- Great Britain rises to hegemonic status

&gt; Hegemony: The predominance of one nation-state over others (FLS, 8).

# The Pax Britannica

What is the *Pax Britannica*?

- Literally, the "British Peace"

- Approximately 1815–1914, from the end of the Napoleonic Wars to the beginning of World War I

- Congress of Vienna:

  - Creates a post-war order in Europe
  
  - Emphasizes balance of power on the continent
  
  - France remains a continental power
  
  - Creates a system of consultation among European leaders
  
  - Partly rooted in fears of democratic revolutionaries

# The Pax Britannica

Global Economic Relations

- Technological innovations increase efficiency and productivity

- Britain leads other nations in move to free trade by relaxing protectionist/mercantilist restrictions

  - Allow imports from other countries
  
  - Increasingly search for markets to which they can export their own goods
  
  - Tariff reductions throughout the 1800s
  
  

---
class: left, top

# The Pax Britannica

Wait, what are these words you keep using?

&gt; **Protectionism**: Policies aimed at protecting domestic industries, often by blocking competing imports from other countries or using subsidies to prop up domestic industries.


&gt; **Tariff**: A tax on imported goods. A major tool used to advance protectionist policies.


&gt; **Subsidies**: Spending by governments to help businesses defray the costs of operating.

Example: The "Corn Laws"

- Impelemented in England in 1815

- Protects domestic agricultural production by taxing imported agricultural goods

- Raises the costs of imports, making domestic goods more attractive

# The Pax Britannica

The/A Gold Standard

- Britain returned to a gold standard in 1819 to help reduce inflationary pressures following the Napoleonic Wars

- Facilitated the move to free trade

- Essentially acted as a common currency

- This becomes more "global" around the 1870s. Many states bi-metallic before this.


---
class: left, top

# The Pax Britannica

Stop—what are these terms again?

&gt; **Monetary Policy**: Pertains to how a country manages the production, supply, and valuation of their currency/money. Not the same as spending and budgets (that's fiscal policy)

&gt; **Gold Standard**: A system where a country's currency (money) is backed by gold and is convertable at a certain rate.

&gt; **Free Trade**: The relaxation or elimination of protectionist policies (it's a matter of degree, not a binary condition).

&gt; **Bi-Metalism**: A monetary systen in which countries use multiple metals to back their currency (e.g. gold *and* silver)

# Notes

How can trade be more than 100% of GDP?!

It's all in how we count: 

$$   GDP = \text{Private Consumption}_{it} + \text{Investment}_{it} + \text{Government Spending}_{it} + (\text{Exports}_{it} - \text{Imports}_{it})    $$

So if total trade (i.e. imports plus exports) is very large then it can exceed overall GDP. In the following example exports are huge, but so are imports, and together they total to 175 (i.e. total trade). 

Example: $$     100 = 25 + 25 + 25 + (100 - 75)      $$

# The Pax Britannica

Except the Pax Britannica isn't so peaceful for everyone

- A new wave of imperialism picks up in the mid-1800s

- States are seeking access to resources

- Looking for new markets

- Also motivated by nationalism, prestige, etc.
