# The Purpose of War



---
# The Purpose of War?

War—what is it good for?

- Two conceptualizations:

  - War serves the national interest
  
  - War serves interests of more narrow social groups
  
  
  
---
# The Purpose of War?

War and the national Interest

- War advances or preserves broad, shared interests

- War is for the "common good"

- We can think of broad concepts like "national security", "national defense", etc.



---
# The Purpose of War?
  
War and narrow interests

- War advances or preserves more narrow, particularistic interests

- These are interests of a more specific subset of the population

- But who?

  - Industries
  - Lobbies
  - Economy

# The Purpose of War?


.pull-left[
Public Goods

- Available to all

- Non-excludable

- Non-rival

- Examples include national defense, clearn air, etc.
]

.pull-right[
Private Goods

- Available to some

- Excludable

- Rival

- Examples include import tariffs, subsidies, monopolies, contracts/grants, etc.

# Breaking Down the State



---
# Breaking Down the State

We talk a lot about the "state", but who are we really talking about?

- Realist or higher level theories often treat states as unitary actors, but reality is obviously more complex

- States are composed of some key groups

  - Leaders
  - Bureaucrats
  - Interest Groups
  - General Public
  
  

---
# Breaking Down the State

Leaders

- Heads of state
- Heads of government
- Legislators
- Policymakers
- Bureaucrats



---
# Breaking Down the State

Bureaucrats

- Aids and advisers to heads of state/government
- Policymakers within larger organizations (e.g. State, DoD, etc.)
- Military personnel
- Diplomats



---
# Breaking Down the State

Interest Groups

- Businesses
- Labor groups
- Military personnel
- Government workers
- Religious and/or ethnic groups
- Human rights organizations





---
# Breaking Down the State

General Public

- You
- You
- You
- You
- You
- You
- You
- And, you
- You
- You, too

# Interests and War



---
# Interests and War

Whose interests does war serve?

--

It depends

We first have to understand what groups want

--

So what *do* these actors want?

--

Well, we have to make some assumptions:

- Policymakers: To stay in office
- Interest groups: To advance their organizational interests (money, budgets, etc.)
- General public: ¯\ \_(ツ)\_/¯ 




---
# Interests and War

The Rally Effect

- The use of military force can raise nationalistic sentiments

- This can be in response to an attack or as a result of initiating conflict

- This may give leaders a boost in public support

---
# Interests and War

Diversionary Incentive

- Leaders want to remain in office but may have limited policy tools available

- Because leaders are aware of the rally effect, they have an incentive to use military force to remedy political problems

- "Gambling for resurrection"

- Various conditions might incentivize such behavior

  - High unemployment
  - High inflation
  - Civil unrest
  - Political scandals

# Interests and War

Reasons to be skeptical

- Evidence is mixed

- Is it even effective?

- Strategic avoidance

- Capabilities

- Risky

# Interests and War

.pull-left[
Special Interests

- Some groups may benefit disproportionately from war while paying few of the costs

- Also suggests a disproportionate ability to influence the decision to use force in the first place

- Classic collective action problems
]

.pull-right[

# Interests and War

.pull-left[
Special Interests

- United Fruit Company in Guatemala

- In 1954 the US/CIA helped to overthrow democratically elected Jacobo Arbenz

- Arbenz implemented land reforms, labor-friendly policies

- Communist!
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="../images/Jacobo Arbenz.jpg" style="width:60%;"&gt;
]



---

# Interests and War

Reasons to be skeptical

- Arbenz implemented many worker-friendly policies

- Cold War made Western governments very wary of anything remotely resembling Communism

- US intervened in many other countries where such strong ties did not exist




---

# Interests and War

The Military

- Maintain edge over potential threats and peer competitors 

- Training and role predispose military leaders to see military solutions to problems

- Makes organization relevant



---

# Interests and War

Reasons to be skeptical

- Evidence indicates prior military experience makes policymakers (in US) less likely to initiate the use of force

- No evidence that military leaders can use positions to substantially influence spending decisions

# Regime Type and War




---
class: left, top

# Regime Type and War


Classical Liberal Theory

- Democracy should curb belligerent behavior

  - Elections
  
  - Separation of powers
  
  - Norms
  
- Empirical evidence shows reality is more complicated




---

# Regime Type and War

What is democracy?

&gt; A political system in which candidates compete for political office through frequent, fair elections in which a sizeable portion of the adult population can vote (FLS)




---

# Regime Type and War


Non-Democracies (everything else)

&gt; **Autocracies**: In mature form, autocracies sharply restrict or suppress competitive political participation. Their chief executives are chosen in a regularized process of selection within the political elite, and once in office they exercise power with few institutional constraints (Polity IV Project Codebook, 15)

&gt; **Anocracy**: Regimes that exhibit a mixture of democratic and autocratic characteristics

---
# Regime Type and War

Selectorate Theory

- Society

- Selectorate

- Winning Coalition



---
# Regime Type and War

Balance between public and private goods

- Small winning coalitions provide more private goods

- Larger winning coalitions provide more public goods

- War and its spoils can be thought of as private good

- Costs of war not incurred by the winning coalition

- To put it differently, benefits of war are concentrated and costs are diffuse

---
# Regime Type and War

Empirical evidence shows us that

- Democracies fight as much as non-democracies 

- Democracies tend to fight with non-democracies

- Mature democracies don't fight one another

- States in transition to democracy may be more belligerent

- Democracies tend to win the fights they get into

- Single-party autocracies intiate conflict at about the same rate as democracies. Constraining effect.
