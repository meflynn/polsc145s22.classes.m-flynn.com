# Lecture Overview

1. Alliancesâ€”what are they?

2. Patterns in alliances over time

3. Why and when do states form alliances?

4. Other forms of security cooperation



---

# Key Questions and Goals

1. Develop an understanding of the factors that drive states to cooperate militarily in general

2. Develop an understanding of the factors that drive more powerful states to ally with weaker states, specifically

3. Define and understand the security-autonomy trade off

4. Develop an understanding of how other issue areas, like trade, investment, and institutions, relate to alliance relationships

# Defining Alliances

We talk about alliances a lot, but what are they?

> **Alliance** Institutions that help their members cooperate militarilty in the event of a war (FLS)

- Note that Alliances are *formal* agreements

- States with common interests and policy goals can coordinate action without formally defining their obligations

- This means they're *aligned* but not necessarily *allied*





---
# Defining Alliances

Frieden, Lake, and Schultz offer a basic definition, but some additional detail might be helpful:

Alliances Treaty Obligations and Provisions (ATOP) definition:

> Written agreements, signed by official representatives of at least two independent states, that includ promises to aid a partner in the event of military conflict, to remain neutral in the event of conflict, to refrain from military conflict with one another, or to consult/cooperate in the even tof international crises that create the potential for military conflict (Leeds, Ritter, Mitchell, and Long 2002: 238).



---
# Defining Alliances

ATOP's definition includes five alliance pact types:

1. Defense

2. Offense

3. Neutrality

4. Nonaggression

5. Consultation

# Alliances as Institutions

# Alliances as Institutions

Alliance agreements outline rules and guidelines for cooperation

- Some may be narrow in scope

- Others can be more comprehensive





---
# Alliances as Institutions


.pull-left[
Example: North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)

- Annual review process, meetings, etc.

- Rules for expansion, leaving

- US enjoys specific privileges and advantages

- 14 Article

  - Article V: Central to collective defense
  
  - Remaining 13 articles are also really important and talk a lot about mutual obligations and goals.

# Why Do States Form Alliances?


A few primary reasons:

- Increase security

- Augment/supplement capabilities

- Balance against rival powers

- Promote other goals

  - Expand influence within regions
  
  - Promote trade and investment
  
  - Promote other ideological or political goals
  
  
  


---
# Why Do States Form Alliances?


Security and capabilities

- Allies supplement your own capabilities 

- Burden sharing

- These can affect other goals

  - Deter rivals
  
  - Facilitate attacks against enemies
  
  
  
  
---
# Why Do States Form Alliances?

These things can affect bargaining environment

- Increases in capabilities may reduce uncertainty

- Public commitments may reveal private information, further reducing uncertainty

- Augment cost and benefit calculus

  - Alliances distribute costs across alliance members
  
  - Distribution of benefits may be more/less concentrated
  
  - Depends upon the public/private nature of the goods

# Why Do States Form Alliances?

Asymmetric Alliances

- Not all alliances are between equals in power

- Strong states frequently ally with weaker states

--

But why? Lots of reasons

- Project power

- Lower costs of power projection

- Increase influence over smaller states' foreign policies

- Secure commercial relationships



---
# Why Do States Form Alliances?

Security-Autonomy Tradeoff

- States give up foreign policy autonomy in exchange for protection

- Smaller states' considerations

  - External threats
  - Constrained budgets
  - Coercive patron state
  
- Larger states' considerations

  - Importance of smaller states' foreign policy choices
  - Geographic position of smaller state
  - Need to project power and force into particulate spaces?
